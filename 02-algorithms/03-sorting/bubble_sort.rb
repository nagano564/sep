# Bubble Sort passes through a collection multiple times. In each pass, it
# compares adjacent items and swaps them according to the desired sorting order.
# The algorithm finishes when there are no swaps done for a complete pass.
# Bubble sort has poor performance when compared to other sorting algorithms.

# Worst Case: O(n^2)
# Average Case: Î˜(n^2)
