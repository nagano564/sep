# Heapsort can be thought of as an improved selection sort: like that algorithm,
# it divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and it iteratively
# shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the smallest element and moving that
# to the sorted region. The improvement consists of the use of a heap data
# structure rather than a linear-time search to find the maximum.
# Worst Case: O(nlgn)
# Average Case: Î˜(nlgn)
