1) It will take 7 iterations to find the value G using linear search.
2) It will take 3 iterations to find the value G using binary search.
3) fib(10) = 34
   fib(11) = 55
   fib(12) = 89

4) For a unsorted collection of a million items you would have to use linear
   search because binary only works for sorted items. From my test below it
   seems that an iterative search is much faster so I would use iterative.

5) For a sorted collection you would use binary search. It is always faster
   to check half of the items per iteration then one by one. From my test below
   it seems that an iterative search is much faster so I would use iterative.

Iterative Search
   user     system      total        real
0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000009)

Recursive Search
user     system      total        real
0.010000   0.000000   0.010000 (  0.003198)
