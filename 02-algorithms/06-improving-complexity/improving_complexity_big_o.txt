1)  The big O of version one is big O(n + n^2)
    flatten is big O(n) plus rubys sort method which is quicksort (n^2)

2) The big O of version two is big O(n + n log n).
    flatten is big O(n) plus merge sort which is (n log n)

3) The big O of version three is the same as version one
   but it improves space complexity because it does not copy the array.
   Using the flatten! will flatten self in place and not use another array
   and copy into it.
