1) O(1) is like driving and 0(2 ^ n) is like walking

2) Best case scenario for binary search is n being right in the middle
   if n is what your looking for

3) Worst case scenario for binary search is n not being in the collection

4) Bounded case would be in between the best case and worst case

5) See n^2.pdf

6) infinity

7) exponential time

8) See linear.rb

9) See linearworst.pdf

10) Binary Search Big 0 or worst case is O(log n)

11) Binary Search Big Omega or best case is O(1)

12) O(log n)
