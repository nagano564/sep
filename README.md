This repository was made to help me track and create assignments for the software engineering principals section of Bloc curriculum which included creating data structures like Hashes, Trees and Graphs in Ruby as well as doing analysis and implementing algorithms. Most of the code might be difficult to understand outside the context of the questions asked, but if you would like to know any of the particular assignments just let me know and I can get you a copy of the information.
